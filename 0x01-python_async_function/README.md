# Python Asynchronous Functions

### Tasks

0. Write an asynchronous coroutine that takes in an integer argument (`max_delay`, with a default value of 10) named `wait_random` that waits for a random delay between 0 and `max_delay` (included and float value) seconds and eventually returns it.

1. execute multiple coroutines at the same time with `async`

2. Measure the runtime

3. Write a function (do not create an async function, use the regular function syntax to do this) task_wait_random that takes an integer `max_delay` and returns a asyncio.Task
